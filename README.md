# Java-Calculator
Peter Pileta, Software Development I, CEN-3024C
Simple calculator application written in Java. It is limited to add, sub, div, and mult operations. 
The app will first ask your name, and then it will ask you to enter the two numbers you want to calculate. The app then will ask you to select an operator, after which will display the results of the operation.
